# TASK-1 
# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PROJECT
The project predicts whether the passenger in Titanic survived or not. For this, we firstly cleaned the dataset, the converted the data to categorical data to perform 
evaluation, then build our model and cross validate it.

DATASET is being embeded with the pynb file. WE also did analysis of data and visualise it using various graphs.

# TASK 2
# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
A machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species. The Iris flower dataset 
consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the 
measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. The size of dataset is too large, so I took it from Machine learning repository Use the Iris 
dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for 
introductory classification tasks.

# TASK 3
# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION 
Since the size of the dataset is 150 MB, therefore I am adding the link of kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud The dataset contains
transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds 
out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) accounts for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the 
only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first 
transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is tthis feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable 
and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
